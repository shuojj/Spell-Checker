It's a God-awful samll affair
To the gril with the mousy hair
But her ummmy is yelling no
And her daddy has told her to go
But her freind is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hokoed to the silver screen
But the film is a saddenig bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She cuold spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on
Sailorz fighting in the dance hall
Oh man, look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man, wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Marsssssssssss?
It's on America's tortured brow
That MickeyMouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dgo, and clowns
But the film is a saddening bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on
Sailors fite in the dance hall
Oh man, look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man, wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?
