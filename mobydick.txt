CALLMEISHMAEL. Some years aog never mind how 
long precisely having little or no money in my purse, 
and nothing parogticar to interest me on shore, I thought 
I would sail about a little and see the watrey part of the 
world. It is a way I have of drviing off the spleen, and 
regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself 
growing grim about the mouth ; whenever it is a dmap, 
drizzly Noemvbre in my soul ; whenever I find myself 
involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing 
up the rear of every funirel I meet ; and especially 
whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that 
it requires a strong moral prencipil to prevent me from 
deliberately stepping into the street, and mithodicelly 
knocking people's hats off then, I account it high time 
to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for 
pistol and ball. With a filosofical flourish Cato throws 
himself upon his sword ; I quietly take to the ship. 
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew 
it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, 
cherish very nearly the same feelings toward the ocean 
with me. 

There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, 
belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs 
commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the 
streets take you waterward. Its extemme down -town is the 
battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and 
cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of 
sight of land. Look at the crowds of water -gazers there.
